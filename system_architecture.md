# Multi-Model NLG System: Architecture and Design Decisions

## System Overview

The Multi-Model NLG System is designed to leverage the strengths of different pre-trained language models (Qwen2.5-1.5B, OPT-1.3B, and LLaMA-3.2 1B) to optimize performance across three natural language generation tasks:

1. **Summarization**: Generating concise and informative summaries of news articles
2. **Question Answering**: Producing free-form answers based on a given context and question
3. **Paraphrase Generation**: Generating semantically equivalent paraphrases for input sentences

The system employs three different multi-model architectures:

1. **Dynamic Decision System**: Selects the most appropriate model for each input based on task-specific heuristics
2. **Ensemble System**: Combines predictions from multiple models to produce a superior final output
3. **Pipeline System**: Uses specialized prompting techniques with a single model to improve output quality

## Core Components

### 1. Model Management

The `ModelManager` class handles the loading, caching, and unloading of models to optimize memory usage:

- **LRU Caching**: Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching mechanism to keep only the most frequently used models in memory
- **Device-Aware Loading**: Automatically selects the best available device (CUDA > MPS > CPU) for model inference
- **Memory Optimization**: Unloads models when they are no longer needed to free up memory

### 2. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning

All models are fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique:

- **Memory Efficiency**: LoRA reduces memory requirements by training only a small number of parameters
- **Training Speed**: Fine-tuning is faster compared to full model fine-tuning
- **Performance**: Achieves comparable performance to full fine-tuning with a fraction of the parameters

### 3. Multi-Model Architectures

#### Dynamic Decision System

The Dynamic Decision System selects the most appropriate model for each input based on task-specific heuristics:

- **Summarization**: Selects models based on input length (longer articles → Qwen, shorter articles → LLaMA)
- **Question Answering**: Selects models based on question complexity and context length
- **Paraphrase Generation**: Selects models based on input sentence length and complexity

#### Ensemble System

The Ensemble System combines predictions from multiple models:

- **Model Selection**: Uses Qwen and OPT models for reliability
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to ensure system stability
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If one model fails, the system falls back to other models

#### Pipeline System

The Pipeline System uses specialized prompting techniques with a single model:

- **Task-Specific Prompts**: Crafts specialized prompts for each task to improve output quality
- **Single-Model Approach**: Uses Qwen model for all tasks for simplicity and reliability
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to ensure system stability

### 4. Unified API

The `UnifiedNLGSystem` class provides a simple interface to the best-performing model/system for each task:

- **Task-Specific Methods**: Provides dedicated methods for each task (summarize, answer_question, generate_paraphrase)
- **Automatic Selection**: Automatically selects the best model/system for each task based on evaluation results
- **Metadata**: Returns detailed metadata along with the generated output (system type, model name, inference time)

## Design Decisions

### 1. Model Selection

We selected three pre-trained language models with different architectures and sizes:

- **Qwen2.5-1.5B**: A versatile model with strong performance across all tasks
- **OPT-1.3B**: A model with good performance on summarization and paraphrase generation
- **LLaMA-3.2 1B**: A model with exceptional performance on paraphrase generation

### 2. Task-Specific Optimization

Each task required different optimization strategies:

#### Summarization

- **Challenge**: Generating concise yet informative summaries
- **Solution**: Used pipeline system with specialized prompting to first extract key points and then generate a coherent summary
- **Result**: Achieved a ROUGE-L score of 0.21 with the pipeline system

#### Question Answering

- **Challenge**: Extracting relevant information from context to answer questions
- **Solution**: Used ensemble system to combine the strengths of multiple models
- **Result**: Achieved a BERTScore of 0.84 with the ensemble system

#### Paraphrase Generation

- **Challenge**: Generating semantically equivalent sentences with different wording
- **Solution**: Used LLaMA model directly, which showed exceptional performance on this task
- **Result**: Achieved a SACREBLEU score of 22.46 with the LLaMA model

### 3. Error Handling and Reliability

We implemented robust error handling throughout the system:

- **Exception Handling**: All model operations are wrapped in try-except blocks
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: If a model fails, the system falls back to alternative models
- **Input Validation**: Validates inputs before processing to prevent errors

### 4. Memory Optimization

Memory usage was optimized through several techniques:

- **Model Unloading**: Models are unloaded when no longer needed
- **LRU Caching**: Only the most frequently used models are kept in memory
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**: LoRA reduces the number of parameters that need to be loaded

### 5. Inference Speed Optimization

Inference speed was optimized through:

- **Device Selection**: Automatically selects the fastest available device
- **Simplified Architectures**: Reduced complexity in multi-model systems
- **Efficient Prompt Design**: Crafted prompts to minimize the number of tokens generated

Through careful design and implementation of dynamic decision, ensemble, and pipeline architectures, the system achieves strong performance while maintaining reasonable inference times and memory usage.
