# Multi-Model System for Optimized Natural Language Generation
## Final Project Report

## Executive Summary

This project developed a multi-model system that leverages the strengths of three pre-trained language models—Qwen2.5-1.5B, OPT-1.3B, and LLaMA-3.2 1B—to optimize performance across three natural language generation tasks: summarization, question answering, and paraphrase generation. The system employs three different multi-model architectures (Dynamic Decision, Ensemble, and Pipeline) to balance accuracy, resource usage, and task-specific optimization.

Our evaluation shows that different architectures excel at different tasks:
- **Paraphrase Generation**: LLaMA model achieved the highest SACREBLEU score (22.46)
- **Question Answering**: Ensemble system achieved the highest BERTScore (0.84)
- **Summarization**: Pipeline system achieved the highest ROUGE-L score (0.21)

We have created a unified API that automatically selects the best model/system for each task, providing a simple interface for users to leverage the strengths of our multi-model approach.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project was to develop a multi-model system that leverages the strengths of different pre-trained models to optimize performance across multiple tasks in Natural Language Generation (NLG). Unlike traditional single-model systems, this project focused on combining multiple models in an intelligent and efficient way to balance accuracy, resource usage, and task-specific optimization.

The challenge lay in creating an efficient system that achieves high performance across tasks while minimizing redundancy and computational cost.

## Methodology

### Models

We selected three pre-trained language models with different architectures and sizes:

1. **Qwen2.5-1.5B**: A versatile model with strong performance across all tasks
2. **OPT-1.3B**: A model with good performance on summarization and paraphrase generation
3. **LLaMA-3.2 1B**: A model with exceptional performance on paraphrase generation

### Fine-Tuning

All models were fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that reduces memory requirements while maintaining performance. We fine-tuned each model on each of the three tasks using the following datasets:

1. **Summarization**: CNN/DailyMail dataset
2. **Question Answering**: SQuAD 2.0 dataset
3. **Paraphrase Generation**: Quora Question Pairs dataset

### Multi-Model Architectures

We implemented three different multi-model architectures:

1. **Dynamic Decision System**: Selects the most appropriate model for each input based on task-specific heuristics
   - For summarization: Selects models based on input length
   - For QA: Selects models based on question complexity and context length
   - For paraphrase: Selects models based on input sentence length

2. **Ensemble System**: Combines predictions from multiple models
   - Uses Qwen and OPT models for reliability
   - Implements robust error handling
   - Falls back to alternative models if one fails

3. **Pipeline System**: Uses specialized prompting techniques with a single model
   - Crafts specialized prompts for each task
   - Uses Qwen model for all tasks
   - Implements robust error handling

### Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated the performance of each model and multi-model system using the following metrics:

1. **Summarization**: ROUGE-L
2. **Question Answering**: BERTScore and ROUGE-L
3. **Paraphrase Generation**: SACREBLEU
4. **Efficiency**: Inference time per query

   - Qwen model showed strong performance across all tasks
   - OPT model performed well on paraphrase generation but lagged behind on other tasks

2. **System Performance**:
   - Ensemble system achieved the best performance on QA tasks
   - Pipeline system achieved strong performance on summarization
   - Direct use of LLaMA model was best for paraphrase generation

3. **Efficiency**:
   - LLaMA model was the most efficient for direct inference
   - Pipeline system was the most efficient multi-model architecture
   - Ensemble system had the highest computational cost

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of four main components:

1. **Model Management**: Handles loading, caching, and unloading of models
2. **Multi-Model Architectures**: Implements the three different multi-model approaches
3. **Task-Specific Processing**: Handles input/output processing for each task
4. **Unified API**: Provides a simple interface to the best model/system for each task

The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for easy extension to new models and tasks. It also includes robust error handling and memory optimization to ensure reliability and efficiency.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Memory Management

**Problem**: Loading multiple large language models simultaneously led to memory issues.

**Solution**: Implemented an LRU caching mechanism in the ModelManager class that keeps only the most frequently used models in memory and unloads others when needed.

### Challenge 2: Model Authentication

**Problem**: Accessing the LLaMA model required authentication with a Hugging Face token.

**Solution**: Implemented a token management system that securely stores and uses the Hugging Face token for model access.

### Challenge 3: System Stability

**Problem**: The ensemble and pipeline systems were prone to errors when processing certain inputs.

**Solution**: Implemented robust error handling throughout the system, with fallback mechanisms to ensure that the system always produces an output even if one model fails.

### Challenge 4: Performance Optimization

**Problem**: Initial implementations of the multi-model systems had high inference times.

**Solution**: Simplified the architectures and implemented more efficient prompt designs to reduce inference time while maintaining performance.

## Conclusion

The Multi-Model NLG System successfully leverages the strengths of different pre-trained language models to optimize performance across summarization, question answering, and paraphrase generation tasks. Through careful design and implementation of dynamic decision, ensemble, and pipeline architectures, the system achieves strong performance while maintaining reasonable inference times and memory usage.

The unified API provides a simple interface for users to leverage the strengths of our multi-model approach, automatically selecting the best model/system for each task.
